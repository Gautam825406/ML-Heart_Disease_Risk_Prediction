# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction System

## 📌 Overview
This is an end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient health data.  
The project demonstrates the complete ML workflow — data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and deployment using Flask.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Predict heart disease risk based on clinical parameters  
- Support early diagnosis and preventive healthcare  
- Showcase real-world machine learning deployment skills  

---

## 🧠 Model & Approach
- Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Feature Scaling: StandardScaler
- Model Persistence: Pickle (.pkl)
- Deployment: Flask Web Application
